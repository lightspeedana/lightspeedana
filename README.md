### Hi! I'm Ana âœ¨

**I'm a BSc Cyber Security student at the University of Warwick.** I have an avid interest in research and development and want to be at the forefront of designing new tools and software to help shape the future of computer security.

I am interning at **Google Munich** in the **Summer of 2022!** I am taking part in the STEP programme, and can't wait to use my skills in real-life software development.

You may also know me as a participant in numerous Cyber Security schemes and competitions in the UK, from CyberCenturion to CyberStart Elite.
