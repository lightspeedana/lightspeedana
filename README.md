### Hi! I'm Ana âœ¨

**I'm a BSc Cyber Security student at the University of Warwick.** I have an avid interest in research and development and want to be at the forefront of designing new tools and software to help shape the future of computer security.

I am currently a **Research Intern at WithSecure** (2023), and was previously a STEP Intern at **Google Munich** (2022). My current work is engaging with criminology, forensic artefacts and cybercrime to find novel ways to protect and improve the lives of those who are victims of cybercrime or technology-facilitated crimes, creating toolsets and improving existing countermeasures. I hope to continue this work beyond my undergraduate dissertation and into a Masters/PhD in the future.

You may also know me as a participant in numerous Cyber Security schemes and competitions in the UK, from **CyberCenturion** to **CyberStart Elite**, as well as a member of several national and international initiatives. I was also the recipient of the **Cyber Student of the Year** award at the **National Cyber Awards 2022**.
