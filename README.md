### Hi! I'm Ana âœ¨

**I'm an MPhil Advanced Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge.** I recently graduated from the University of Warwick, studying Cyber Security, and am looking forward to developing my interests in research and development. I want to be at the forefront of designing new tools and software to help shape the future of computer security.

I was previously a **Research Intern at WithSecure** (2023), and a STEP Intern at **Google Munich** (2022). My current work is engaging with criminology, forensic artefacts and cybercrime to find novel ways to protect and improve the lives of those who are victims of cybercrime or technology-facilitated crimes, creating toolsets and improving existing countermeasures. I completed my undergraduate dissertation, focusing on Android stalkerware and how to find comprehensive indicators of hacked devices using a series of scripts and a framework I developed. I hope to continue this work into my Masters and even a PhD in the future, so if this sounds interesting to you, please do get in contact with me!

You may also know me as a participant in numerous Cyber Security schemes and competitions in the UK, from **CyberCenturion** to **CyberStart Elite**, as well as a member of several national and international initiatives. I was also the recipient of the **Cyber Student of the Year** award at the **National Cyber Awards 2022**.
